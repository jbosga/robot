# Robot

This repo contains code for a small robot I built. It is called Rob. 

Right now, it can move around without bumping into too many things, and it can pretty accurately detect 
potted plants. 

The hardware:
- Lego Mindstorms EV3
- Arduino Uno
- Raspberry Pi
- USB Webcam
- 5V powerbank
- 5V rechargeable battery

The software:
- Basic movement logic
- Basic sonar-based obstacle avoidance
- Object detection for about 80 common objects

Still to do:
- Camera pan/tilt
- SLAM or some other form of localization (GPS for outside navigation?)
- Text-to-speech so Rob can tell me fun facts about the potted plants it finds
