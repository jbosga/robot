# Robot

This repo contains code for a small robot I built. It is called Rob. 

The hardware:
- Lego Mindstorms EV3
- Arduino Uno
- Raspberry Pi
- USB Webcam
- 5V powerbank

The software:
- Basic movement logic
- Basic sonar-based obstacle avoidance
- Object detection for about 80 common objects

Still to do:
- Camera pan/tilt
- Autonomous goal-driven behavior (such as spotting and navigating towards potted plants)
- SLAM or some other form of localization (GPS for outside navigation?)
